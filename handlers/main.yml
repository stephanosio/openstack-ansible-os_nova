# Note (odyssey4me):
# The policy.json file is currently read continually by the services
# and is not only read on service start. We therefore cannot template
# directly to the file read by the service because the new policies
# may not be valid until the service restarts. This is particularly
# important during a major upgrade. We therefore only put the policy
# file in place after the service has been stopped.
